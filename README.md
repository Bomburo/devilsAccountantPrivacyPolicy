# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the mobile game developed by us using the Unity engine for Android devices.

## Data Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data or user information.  
Our game does not use Unity Analytics, Unity Ads, or any third-party analytics or advertising services.

## Permissions

The app does not request access to sensitive permissions (such as location, contacts, microphone, or camera) and operates fully offline without any tracking or data transmission.

## Third-Party Services

No third-party services are integrated that would collect user data.  
The Unity engine is used strictly for game development purposes, without activating or including any optional Unity services that track or collect data.

## Changes

If our privacy practices change in the future (e.g., we add analytics or ads), we will update this policy accordingly and notify users as required.
